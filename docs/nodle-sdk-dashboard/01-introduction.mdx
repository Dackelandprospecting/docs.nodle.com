# Introduction

In this documentation you'll find the information you need to get started with the [SDK Dashboard](https://sdk.nodle.com).

The Nodle SDK dashbooard is designed to help you better track your assets (NODL) earned in your apps, the users using it, SDK versions, and more.
With the dashboard you'll be able to get visibility of your balance, from the address itself in the blockchain, and also from the Nodle SDK.
Everything from a single dashboard focused in that.
