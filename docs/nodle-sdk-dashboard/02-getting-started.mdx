# Getting started

First thing you'll gonna do is to make sure you have installed polkadot.js extension installed in your browser.
You can find it here: https://polkadot.js.org/extension/

Then you'll need to create a new Nodle account and save the mnemonic phrase somewhere safe.

## First access in the dashboard

Once you have created your Nodle account and already have your address, you'll be able to use it in the dashboard and as public key in the Nodle app.

You can access the dashboard here: https://sdk.nodle.com

First thing you'll see is a page with authentication in it. You can fill the form with your best e-mail for professional use.
